## How It Works

This project utilizes the [League of Legends Live Client API](https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/lol#game-client-api_live-client-data-api) to get your in-game stats to calculate the appropriate times to issue moves and attacks.
Using [LowLevelInput.Net](https://github.com/michel-pi/LowLevelInput.Net), `OddAutoWalker` is able to capture the user's input and know when to start issuing actions. The actions are hardware emulated using pinvoke and `SendInput` found in the [InputSimulator.cs](OddAutoWalker/InputSimulator.cs) class

## Using This Program
<details>
    <summary>Important Note</summary>
    <p>
        <i>
            <b>
                While this program is usable, it is intended to be used as reference for both a better implementation and your own project.
                <br>
                <br>
                If you don't want to mess with the program yourself, you must have your "Player Attack Move" bound to 'A'. <br>
                This setting can be found in the in-game settings at Settings->Hotkeys->Player Movement.

## Configuration

Additional settings available in `settings/settings.json`:

- `EnableAdaptiveTimer` - Enable/disable adaptive timer system
- `EnableSmartMoveLogic` - Enable/disable smart movement logic  
- `MinMoveIntervalSeconds` - Minimum movement interval
- `MinMoveCommandIntervalSeconds` - Minimum move command interval
- `MaxMoveCommandIntervalSeconds` - Maximum move command interval

## Fork Improvements

This fork enhances the original [approved/OddAutoWalker](https://github.com/approved/OddAutoWalker) with:

- **Adaptive Timer System** - Dynamically adjusts timer intervals based on attack speed for smoother orb walking
- **Smart Move Logic** - Uses curve algorithms to reduce movement command frequency, preventing disconnection issues
- **Enhanced Configuration** - More settings options with backward compatibility for fine-tuning
- **Performance Monitoring** - API call statistics and attack speed change detection for better stability
